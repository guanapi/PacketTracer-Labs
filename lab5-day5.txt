Lab 5: Security and VLANs

Objective:
✅ Segregate the network into different VLANs to improve security and management.
✅ Apply basic security rules, such as disabling unused ports and setting passwords on the switch.

Topology:

    1 router
    1 switch
    6 computers (3 for VLAN 10 and 3 for VLAN 20)

Steps:

    1- Connect all computers to the switch.
    2- Connect the switch to the router.
    3- Disable all unused switch ports.
    4- Set passwords to prevent unauthorized connections (in global configuration, line console 0, and line vty 0 4).
    5 - Assign ports to VLANs.
    6 - Assign names to VLANs (e.g., VLAN 10 = Sales Department, VLAN 20 = Support Department).
    7 - Assign static IPs to the PCs.
    8 - Check connectivity.
    9 -Configure the router.
